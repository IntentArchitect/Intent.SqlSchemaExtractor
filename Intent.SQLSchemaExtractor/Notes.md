- Columns which are FK sources appear as both an attribute and association. Can be filtered out by checking attributes against associations.
- We're probably matching existing vs database on class name, rather than  matching against the RDBMS "Table" stereotypes name (since class names and table names may differ). Same applies to attributes/columns.
